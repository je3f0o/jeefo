# jeefo
Jeefo is a "ES8 Web Application Framework" written in NodeJS. Which has CLI or 
Command Line tool Interface with many commands with many more options. In 
Front-End side it has it's own templating language and Angular like framework 
in common js pattern design. Which is very nice for NodeJS and Angular 
developers. Because since Angular 2 they moved to TypeScript. So I wanted to 
programm everything in same language. Which is one of the biggest reason to 
create this framework. In Back-End it uses expressjs. (UNDER DEVELOPMENT)
